# eigenvalue-problem

This is a repo with the solution for a computational problem proposed in Numerical Methods (MAP3122) class at University of Sao Paulo. The computational problem is related to the concept of [Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) from Linear Algebra. You can find the instructions for the problem in [here](instructions.pdf).
